        <h1>Melting Potatoes</h1>
        <p>These melting potatoes are aptly named, as high-heat roasting creates a crispy exterior, while a final broth addition makes them extra creamy. Serve them with roasted chicken and a salad for dinner.</p>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch slices</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary</li>
                <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground pepper</li>
                <li>1 cup low-sodium vegetable broth or chicken broth</li>
                <li>5 clove garlic, peeled and smashed</li>
            </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Position rack in upper 3rd of oven; preheat to 500Â°F.</li>
                <li>Toss potatoes, butter oil, thyme, rosemary, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Arrange in a single layer in a 9-by-13-inch metal baking pan. (Do not use a glass dish, which could shatter.) Roast, flipping once, until browned, about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Carefully add broth and garlic to the pan. Continue roasting until most of the broth is absorbed and the potatoes are very tender, about 15 minutes more. Serve hot.</li>
            </ol>
